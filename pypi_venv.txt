suppose in our machine, we have a module requests 20.0.2 installed
But for a project, we need specific version 19.0.1 of requests
we cant just uninstall 20.0.2 and install 19.0.1 as other projects will impact
to solve this, we will cr8 a virtual env for the project in a specific folder
the venv will contain all its dependencies of specific versions

commad to create venv:
python3 -m venv env

This will create DIr env
env
|
---> lib
      -->python3.7
            ----> site-packages (This folder will contain all python packages specific to this venv only
---> bin
      --> activate
      to activate in win: \env\bin\activate.bat
      to activate in linux: source env/bin/activate
      Then we can install any module
      pip3 install requests==2.9.0
      deactivate
